# Soundboard
This is a customizable Soundboard for Windows. I never found one that got endless buttons and a high customizability. Easy to use, just add a Sound and play it.

What's working?
  - Add and remove Sounds
  - Play sounds in normal mode and Spam mode
  - Set Volume
  - Stop all playing sounds
  - Support for .mp3 (.wav not tested yet but should work)
  - Endless sound Buttons
  - Color Control
  - Custom Button names
  - Hotkey function
  - Easy button management form
  
What's planned?
  - Random sound button
  - Cloud save
  - Stop Hokeysounds
  - Removing that the numpad is locked (New Hotkey function is needed)
  - Dynamically disable Hotkey
  - Faster site switching
  - Seachrching for sound
  - Check for new Version
  - OTA-Update
  
How does it work?

  - If you want to use it for Discord / TeamSpeak you'll need a program that merges your Audio in and Outputs like Voicemeeter banana and Voicemeeter Virtual audio Cabvle
    Tutorial on setting up  Voicemeeter (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYGuEY0WdSw)
    
  - You'll need to change the audio output of the Soundboard. Open Windows Settings -> System -> Sound -> App Volume and device preferences.
    Set the output of the Soundboard to youre Voicemeet input (Like Cable Input). That's it it should work now.
      - If you don't see the Soundboard in the Settings just play a random sound on the Soundboard and it should appear in the Settings
      
      
Known Bugs:
  - Volume sometimes not working (Currently not fixable. Not working because Voicemeeter) 
  - If the sound is crackling in for example Discord, this should help you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix3VvzeqVig
